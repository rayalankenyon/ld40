the more you have the WORSE it is

rts style combat -> the more units you have the harder the game is to control
	-> doesn't mean the game is worse

perspective = top down ? (simplest graphically)


what gets worse with the more units you have? 
	game gets harder to control but making the controls even
	harder isn't really fun

	

rts survival? 
	you have to feed the units you have contrinuously
	horde of enemies tries to attack you 
	the more people you have the more enemies you deal with


what resources do you need to deal with
	food
		when units are not hungry they heal small wounds over time
	first aid
		heals units from critical damage
	painkillers
		take less damage
	trees/stones?
	
critical damage
	when a unit takes more than 1/2 their hp in damage they bleed out
		slowly
	under 1/4 hp units move very slowly, must be assisted
	can be fixed with first aid
